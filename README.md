# PathFinding with A* Algorithm

## Overview

This repository features implementations of the A* algorithm for pathfinding. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to visualize the algorithm in action. Users can set the start and end points on the map, place barriers, and observe how the algorithm finds the shortest path between the selected points.

## Features

- **A* Algorithm**: Efficient pathfinding algorithm that calculates the shortest path between two points on a map.
- **Interactive GUI**: Users can interact with the map, setting start/end points and placing barriers.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Observe the pathfinding process in real-time as the algorithm navigates through the map.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asoron/PathFinding.git
